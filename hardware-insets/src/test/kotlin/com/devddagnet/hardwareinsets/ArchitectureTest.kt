/**
 * Holds the library's layers apart by reading the imports off `src/main`.
 *
 * Three layers, and the dependencies only ever point inward:
 *
 * - `domain` is the shapes, the edges and the maths. It may use value types
 *   and constants, and it may not touch a framework object or Compose. This is
 *   what makes `cornerClearanceFor` answerable about hardware nobody owns, and
 *   that claim is the library's whole argument.
 * - `platform` reads the real window: a `View`, an `Activity`, the constants
 *   the framework wants. It knows `domain`.
 * - The root package is the Compose front door. It knows both.
 *
 * A new file joins these rules by existing. Nothing has to be registered.
