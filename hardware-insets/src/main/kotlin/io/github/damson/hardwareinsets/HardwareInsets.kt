 * @param policy which of the window's insets count. See [HardwarePolicy].
 * @param isFarEdgeIgnored whether the edge opposite [position] is forced to
 *   zero. Off by default, so all four edges are reported. Set it where the
 *   composable is hosted in a `wrap_content` `ComposeView`: an inset on the far
 *   edge grows that view, and a `ComposeView` swallows every touch inside its

 *
 * The full-width inset is the wrong question: a centred punch-hole reports one
 * across the whole width, which would drop a corner tab a centimetre to avoid a
 * camera it is nowhere near. So the cutout's rectangles are read and only the
 * ones the control overlaps count. A waterfall curve has no rectangle and is
 * taken whole -- it runs the length of the side.
 *
 * **Horizontal edges only.** Given [ScreenEdge.LEFT] or [ScreenEdge.RIGHT] this
 * returns a function that always answers [IntOffset.Zero], because the geometry
 * behind it measures a control's width against an edge that runs across the
 * window. A control on a side needs its height measured against a side instead,
 * which is not implemented.
 *
 * @param cutoutBounds where the cameras are: [CutoutShape.bounds], as
 *   [cutoutShape] publishes it.
 * @param position which edge the control is tucked against. A cutout on the
 *   other edge is not in its way and must not move it. A vertical edge yields
 *   the zero function, per above.
 * @param isAtTheEnd whether the control sits in the edge's end corner rather
 *   than its start one, which decides which side's hardware is in its way.
 *
 * @return the offset the control should be placed at, relative to its corner:
 *   `x` in from the control's own end of the edge, `y` in from the anchored edge.
