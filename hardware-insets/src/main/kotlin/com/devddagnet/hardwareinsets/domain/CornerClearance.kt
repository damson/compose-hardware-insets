/**
 * The geometry `cornerClearance` is built on, kept pure so it can be tested
 * against rectangles no emulator here has the hardware to produce, and exposed
 * so a caller laying out its own control can ask the same question.
 *
 * A rectangle counts only if it overlaps the control's width **and** touches the
 * edge the control is anchored to. Without that second test a camera in the top
 * edge would push a bottom-anchored handle almost the height of the screen, and
 * a chin at the bottom would push a top-anchored one off it -- the platform
 * reports every cutout on the window, not only the near one.
 *
 * @param cutoutBounds the cutout rectangles, in window coordinates and pixels.
 * @param controlWidth how wide the control is, in pixels.
 * @param sideInset how far in from the near side the control already sits.
 * @param windowSize the window's size in pixels, not the host view's. A view
 *   inside a `wrap_content` host measures the host, and the rectangles above
 *   are in window coordinates, so the two would not be in the same space.
 * @param corner which corner of the window the control is tucked into, which
 *   decides both the side the width is measured from and the edge a rectangle
 *   has to touch to count.
 * @return the offset to place the control at, relative to its corner.
