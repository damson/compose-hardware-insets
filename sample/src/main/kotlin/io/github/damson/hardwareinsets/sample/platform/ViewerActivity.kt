/**
 * A full-bleed gallery, which wants the opposite of what a form wants: the
 * plate under the camera, and the wall label kept off it.
 *
 * It closes on the system Back gesture and offers no button for it. The corner
 * is spent on favouriting and sharing, which is what a viewer actually needs
 * there, and a screen whose only corner control closed it would not be
 * demonstrating a corner worth defending.
 *
 * The window-level options live here because they are window-level: the cutout
 * mode is an attribute, hiding a bar is a controller call, and so is deciding
 * whether the bar's icons are dark. None of the three is a composable's.
